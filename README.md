# Getting Started with Llama 4 on AWS Bedrock - Team Guide

A beginner-friendly guide to using Meta's Llama 4 Maverick model through AWS Bedrock.

## ðŸŽ¯ What You'll Learn

- How to set up your AWS credentials on your computer
- How to run your first conversation with Llama 4
- Understanding the basics without being a developer

## ðŸ“‹ What You'll Need

1. **Your AWS credentials** (provided by your admin)
   - Access Key ID (looks like: AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE)
   - Secret Access Key (looks like: wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY)
2. **Python installed** - Version 3.8 or newer
3. **A text editor** - Notepad++, VS Code, or even regular Notepad
4. A convenience script config.sh has been created in the repo
5. Add your keys to the file.  DO NOT share keys or this file (no public repos please!)
6. Run chmod =x ./config.sh to make it executable
7. Run with ./config.sh 

## ðŸš€ Step 1: Set Up Your AWS Credentials

### For Mac/Linux Users

1. Open Terminal
2. Type these commands one at a time (replace with YOUR actual keys):

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="paste-your-access-key-here"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="paste-your-secret-key-here"
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="us-west-2"
```

**Important**: These settings only last for your current terminal session. When you close Terminal, you'll need to run them again.

### For Windows Users

1. Open Command Prompt (press Windows key, type "cmd", press Enter)
2. Type these commands one at a time (replace with YOUR actual keys):

```cmd
set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=paste-your-access-key-here
set AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=paste-your-secret-key-here
set AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-west-2
```

**Important**: These settings only last for your current Command Prompt session. When you close it, you'll need to run them again.

## ðŸ“¦ Step 2: Install Required Software

In the same Terminal or Command Prompt window, run:

```bash
pip install boto3
```
## ðŸ“¦ Step 3: Run 'llamaBedock.py

python llamabedrock.py

```

## What Success Looks Like

If everything is working, you'll see:
```

## Common Issues and Fixes

### "Could not connect to AWS. Check your credentials."
- Make sure you set the credentials in the SAME terminal window
- Check for typos in your access keys
- Try copying and pasting instead of typing

### "AccessDeniedException"
- Your AWS account doesn't have permission to use Llama 4
- Contact your administrator to enable Bedrock access

### "No module named 'boto3'"
- The installation didn't work
- Try: `python -m pip install boto3`

### Nothing happens / Can't find Python
- Make sure Python is installed
- Try `python3` instead of `python`
- On Windows, you might need to use the full path: `C:\Python39\python.exe`
