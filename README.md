# Getting Started with AI Models on AWS Bedrock - Team Guide
A beginner-friendly guide to using AI language models through AWS Bedrock.

## What You'll Learn
- How to set up your AWS credentials on your computer
- How to run your first conversation with AI models on Bedrock
- Understanding the basics without being a developer

##  What You'll Need
1. **Your AWS credentials** (provided by your admin)
   - Access Key ID (looks like: AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE)
   - Secret Access Key (looks like: wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY)
2. **Python installed** - Version 3.8 or newer
3. **A text editor** - Notepad++, VS Code, or even regular Notepad
4. **A convenience script** - We've included `config.sh` in the repo to make credential setup easier 

## Step 1: Set Up Your AWS Credentials

### Option A: Using the Convenience Script (Recommended)
We've included a helpful script to make this easier:

1. Open the `config.sh` file in your text editor
2. Add your AWS credentials to the file (replace the placeholder values)
3. **IMPORTANT**: DO NOT share this file or commit it to public repos!
4. Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x ./config.sh
```
5. Run the script:
```bash
. ./config.sh
```

### Option B: Manual Setup

#### For Mac/Linux Users
1. Open Terminal
2. Type these commands one at a time (replace with YOUR actual keys):
```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="paste-your-access-key-here"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="paste-your-secret-key-here"
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="us-west-2"
```
**Important**: These settings only last for your current terminal session. When you close Terminal, you'll need to run them again.

#### For Windows Users
1. Open Command Prompt (press Windows key, type "cmd", press Enter)
2. Type these commands one at a time (replace with YOUR actual keys):
```cmd
set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=paste-your-access-key-here
set AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=paste-your-secret-key-here
set AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-west-2
```
**Important**: These settings only last for your current Command Prompt session. When you close it, you'll need to run them again.

## Step 2: Install Required Software
In the same Terminal or Command Prompt window, run:
```bash
pip install boto3
```

## Step 3: Run Your Bedrock Chat Script
```bash
python bedrock_chat.py
```

## What Success Looks Like
If everything is working, you'll see:
```
Connecting to AWS Bedrock...
âœ“ Connected to AWS successfully!
Welcome to AI Model Chat!
Type your messages and press Enter to send.
Type 'quit', 'exit', or 'bye' to end the conversation.

```

## Common Issues and Fixes
### "Could not connect to AWS. Check your credentials."
- Make sure you set the credentials in the SAME terminal window
- Check for typos in your access keys
- Try copying and pasting instead of typing

### "AccessDeniedException"
- Your AWS account doesn't have permission to use Bedrock models
- Contact your administrator to enable Bedrock access

### "No module named 'boto3'"
- The installation didn't work
- Try: `python -m pip install boto3`

### Nothing happens / Can't find Python
- Make sure Python is installed
- Try `python3` instead of `python`
- On Windows, you might need to use the full path: `C:\Python39\python.exe`

## Available Models
Your administrator will configure which models are available to your team. Common options include:
- Amazon Nova Pro
- Amazon Nova Lite
- Claude Sonnet 3.5
- Other AI models as they become available

Contact your admin if you need access to specific models or have questions about which one to use for your project.
